# UFO
### Overview of the analysis:
The point of this project was to further narrow downn search results for UFO sightings. The original html
document only allowed us to search sightings by the date which was limiting and didn't allow us to get more specific. We can now search by 
5 different categories to give us more detailed results from the search menu. We made this happen with the 
<li code
Ex
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark">
<label for="date">Enter a Shape</label>
<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="triangle" id="shape">
</li>"

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
Summary:
